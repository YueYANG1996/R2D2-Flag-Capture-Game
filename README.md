# Robot Excercise 3: Flag Capture Game with Minimax Algorithm

## Instructions
In this assignment, you will combine your knowledege of informed search algorithm with the adversarial search game tree to teach the R2D2s how to play optimally in a flag capture game.

## Step 1: Create the Game Board
Similar to the A* game in last excercise, the game board also takes in the vertices and edges to define a graph. In addition to these two parameters, we also need to define the position of the robots and the flags.

```python
def __init__(self, V, E, initial_state, flag):
	'''
		self.vertics --  store the vertics of the graph
		self.edges   --  store the edges of the graph
		self.map     --  store the state of the gameboard
		self.state   --  dictionary to represent the state of each grid
		self.robot_pos -- store the positions of the robots
		self.flag    -- store the positions of the flags
	'''
	pass
	
def neighbors(self, u):
	'''
		return the neighbors of a grid, 
		if there is a robot occupies the neighboring grid, 
		it will not be take as a neighbor.
	'''
	pass

def dist_between(self, u, v):
	'''
		return the distance between two vertics
	'''
	pass
```
You could expect the following outputs:

```python
>>> V = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
>>> E = [((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (0, 2)), ((0, 1), (1, 1)), ((0, 1), (0, 0)), ((0, 2), (0, 3)), ((0, 2), (1, 2)), ((0, 2), (0, 1)), ((0, 3), (1, 3)), ((0, 3), (0, 2)), ((1, 0), (0, 0)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 0), (2, 0)), ((1, 1), (0, 1)), ((1, 1), (1, 2)), ((1, 1), (2, 1)), ((1, 1), (1, 0)), ((1, 2), (0, 2)), ((1, 2), (1, 3)), ((1, 2), (2, 2)), ((1, 2), (1, 1)), ((1, 3), (0, 3)), ((1, 3), (2, 3)), ((1, 3), (1, 2)), ((2, 0), (1, 0)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((2, 1), (1, 1)), ((2, 1), (2, 2)), ((2, 1), (3, 1)), ((2, 1), (2, 0)), ((2, 2), (1, 2)), ((2, 2), (2, 3)), ((2, 2), (3, 2)), ((2, 2), (2, 1)), ((2, 3), (1, 3)), ((2, 3), (3, 3)), ((2, 3), (2, 2)), ((3, 0), (2, 0)), ((3, 0), (3, 1)), ((3, 1), (2, 1)), ((3, 1), (3, 2)), ((3, 1), (3, 0)), ((3, 2), (2, 2)), ((3, 2), (3, 3)), ((3, 2), (3, 1)), ((3, 3), (2, 3)), ((3, 3), (3, 2))]
>>> state = [['D2_1', 'x', 'x', 'x'], ['D2_2', 'x', 'x', 'x'], ['x', 'x', 'x', 'Q5_1'], ['x', 'x', 'x', 'Q5_2']]
>>> flag = {'flag_D2': (3, 2), 'flag_Q5': (0, 1)}
>>> graph = FlagCaptureGraph(V, E, state, flag)

>>> graph.map
[['D2_1', 'x', 'x', 'x'], ['D2_2', 'x', 'x', 'x'], ['x', 'x', 'x', 'Q5_1'], ['x', 'x', 'x', 'Q5_2']]

>>> graph.printmap()
* x x x 
* x x x 
x x x o 
x x x o 

>>> graph.state
{(0, 0): 'D2_1', (0, 1): 'x', (0, 2): 'x', (0, 3): 'x', (1, 0): 'D2_2', (1, 1): 'x', (1, 2): 'x', (1, 3): 'x', (2, 0): 'x', (2, 1): 'x', (2, 2): 'x', (2, 3): 'Q5_1', (3, 0): 'x', (3, 1): 'x', (3, 2): 'x', (3, 3): 'Q5_2'}

>>> graph.robot_pos
{'D2_1': (0, 0), 'D2_2': (1, 0), 'Q5_1': (2, 3), 'Q5_2': (3, 3)}

>>> graph.neighbors((0, 0))
[(0, 1)]

>>> graph.dist_between((0, 0), (0, 1))
1.0
```
## Step 2: Define the Game Rules
In this step, we will define the basic rules of the game, such as how to judge whether the game is over, how to update the game state when perform a move on the robot, etc.

```python
def copy(self):
	pass
	
def successors(self, D2):
	pass

def perform_move(self, current_state, move_state):
	pass
	
def game_over(self):
	pass
```
```perform_move(self, current_state, move_state)``` excute the movement of the robot and update the game object accordingly. The game

```copy(self)```function just return a new game object by deep copy of current game.

```python

```

## Step 3: Define the A* algorithm and the evaluate function
Implement the A star to calculate the shortest path between two vertics. This step is almost the same as the solution of excercise 2, but it should be noticed that, in the cases of the opponents occupy the flag, the path cannot lead to the goal(robots will be considered as obstacles), thus the total length of the path should be modified.

```python
def Astar(self, start, goal):
	'''
		return the path and length of the path
		in the form of (path, len(path))
	'''
	pass
```
Using the same parameters of graph as above, you could expect the following outputsï¼š

```python
>>> graph.Astar((0, 0), (2, 2))
([(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)], 5)
```

The ```evaluate(self, D2)``` estimate the utilities (scores) of current state which reflect the chance of wining the game. There are various methods to evaluate the utilities in this game, and different approaches will have influence on the performance of the robot and game results. Here is a recommended solution: using the difference of the minimum cost to reach the flag of seach team as the utility.

```python
def evaluate(self, D2):
	pass
```

## Step 4: Implement Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
In this part, you will utilize your knowledge of alpha-beta minimax algorithm to help the R2D2s find out the optimal movements.

```python
def alpha_beta_max(self, D2, original_D2, limit, alpha, beta):
	pass

def alpha_beta_min(self, D2, original_D2, limit, alpha, beta):
	pass

def get_best_move(self, D2, limit):
	pass
```

After you finished the minimax algorithm, you could now play the game in a virtual environment.

```python
>>> from game_simulation import simulate_game
>>> record_game = simulate_game(graph, D2 = True, limit = 4)
Round: 1
D2 Turn
x * x x 
* x x x 
x x x o 
x x x o 
             
x * x x 
x x x x 
* x x o 
x x x o 
             
Q5 Turn
x * x x 
x x x o 
* x x x 
x x x o 
             
x * x x 
x x x o 
* x x x 
x x o x 

...

Q5 Turn
x o x x 
x x x * 
x * x x 
o x x x 
             
Q5 WIN
```

## Step 5: Let our Robots rolling in a real game
You will apply your algorithm in the real robots to visulize your program.

```python
>>> from client import DroidClient
>>> from r2d2_action import action
###replace with your own tags###
>>> robot_tag = {'D2_1': 'D2-FE32', 'D2_2': 'D2-3493', 'Q5_1': 'Q5-D26A', 'Q5_2': 'Q5-B348'}
>>> droid1 = DroidClient()
>>> droid2 = DroidClient()
>>> droid3 = DroidClient()
>>> droid4 = DroidClient()
>>> Droids = {'D2_1': droid1, 'D2_2': droid2, 'Q5_1': droid3, 'Q5_2': droid4}
>>> for key in robot_tag:
...     Droids[key].connect_to_droid(robot_tag[key])
```

```python
###adjust the speed and time according to the grid size###
speed = 0.4
time = 1.5
action(record_game, Droids, speed, time)
```
